This model provides us a completely new way of judging one's financial fitness by taking into consideration 24 different parameters which can determine how well are you doing financially. It gives a score out of 100 which gives an idea of the financial fitness of a person. 
I took into account 4 major factors that I used in making the main hypothesis namely, loan approval probability, credit card approval probability, does the person have emergency funds and can the individual meet his/her financial goals. I combined data and results from each sector, assigned weights and made a scorer.
Fitness Score Hypothesis Description:
Fitness of a person can be defined as how well the person does in times of need or in emergency situations. Using the same analogy, I calculated the probability of a person to get out of a financial emergency like loan, etc or his/her credibility by seeing if his/her credit card can be approved or not and then took, for example, 45% part of a certain probability because that depicts financial fitness more in comparison to the one that contributes only 9% to the score and made a score out of 100 which defines how fit a person is, financially.
