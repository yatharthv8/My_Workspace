This Dataset was taken from Kaggle so the actual test case accuracy which was obtained after after submission of the saved files (having the predicted result are as follows):
Submissions For Titanic survival model using linear regression 						: 0.72966
Submissions For Titanic survival model using RandomForestClassifier					: 0.78468
Submissions For Titanic survival model using Logistic Regression					: 0.77033
Submissions For Titanic survival model using GaussianNB							: 0.75358
Submissions For Titanic survival model using KNeighborsClassifier					: 0.74401
Submissions For Titanic survival model using Support Vector Machine(Classifier)				: 0.76555
Submissions For Titanic survival model using Artificial Neural Networks(with 10 middle layer nodes)	: 0.76076
Submissions For Titanic survival model using Artificial Neural Networks(with 100 middle layer nodes)	: 0.77751
The above results show that is the best stuited model among all the models if Random Forest Classifier and the reason behind this is models like Decision Trees are the most effective ways to make binary classifications like these. Regression models on the other hand can be used to predict the probabilty of survival of a person more precisely.
