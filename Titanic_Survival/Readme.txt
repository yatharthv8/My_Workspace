This Project is a cumulative study of different types of models(Linear Regression, Random Forest Classifiers, Artificial Neural Networks, etc.) and their prediciton results for Titanic Survivor database.
This database is taken from Kaggle.
The project compares the accuracy(predictions) of 8 different results from 8 different classifiers and models which make use of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques.
Graphical representaion is also done for ease of understanding.
